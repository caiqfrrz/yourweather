## Getting Started

### API configuration
To connect the app to a weather service, you'll need to configure your API keys:

1. **Get an API key:**
   - Create an account and get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) (to get to use the One Call 3.0 API you will need billing information attributed to your OpenWeather account, but you can limit the calls to 1000 calls per day to make sure you will not be charged, as the API gives 1000 free calls per day.)
     
2. **Configure the API key**
   - Add your API key to the code as:
   ```sh
   let API_KEY = (api key)
   ```
   - Be careful when sharing your code and remember your key is in there.
  

### Now you can run the code
